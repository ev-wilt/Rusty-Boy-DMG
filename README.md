# Rusty Boy DMG

Rusty Boy DMG is an emulator for the original Nintendo Gameboy written in the Rust programming language. While support for the Gameboy Color may be added in the future, the current focus is on the original Gameboy model.

# Running a ROM

To run a ROM, you'll first need to build the emulator with the following command. You'll need SDL2 installed and cargo installed for this command to work.

```cargo build --release```

After that, the binary file will be created and placed in ```/target/release```.

Execute the binary and pass in the directory of the ROM you want to run.

```./rusty_boy_dmg /test_roms/rom_name.gb```
